# Gaussian-Covariance

My modifications to TJPCov examples: https://github.com/LSSTDESC/TJPCov/tree/master/examples which adds `xi-` to the gaussian covariance matrix.
For now it assumes that your source-source tracer combinations (shear shear correlations) are at the end of the `trace_combs` list.
